### This is a web audio synthesizer project for personal use.
The point of this project is to make something useful for myself in the world of digital audio, learn react.js, tone.js and webmidi.js as well as gain more experience in building things for the web. Through this project
I hope to learn more, write clean and readable code and see where javascript inefficiencies start to show as this project grows bigger. Hopefully i'll be able to tackle those challenges as I try to make a capable web synthesizer that pushes the understanding of the modern web.
